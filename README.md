# Mental_Health_Predictor
The project adopted a comprehensive approach to predicting depression by employing various machine learning algorithms on firsthand data. Beginning with data preprocessing and visualization techniques, the focus was on ensuring data quality and gaining insights into its characteristics. Methods such as handling missing values, encoding variables, and exploring variable relationships graphically were utilized. Subsequently, several machine learning algorithms were implemented and fine-tuned, including k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. Each algorithm was evaluated for its effectiveness in predicting depression levels. Through these techniques, the project aimed to provide accurate predictions for mental health concerns.
